2016-10-21 unicode and json DK 8.2016 100.1 -> 100
2016-10-21 unicode and json UK almost all series wrong 
2016-12-16 unicode and json FI several values wrong 
adjusted retail trade unicode all series wrong
For unadjusted retail trade there is some missing sdmx data (bad url for some
time?) between 2016-3-30 and 2016-5-23 so the sdmx first revision series is
quite off for many countries for February and March as retail trade date is
often revised. Consequently we take the json data but we insert ireland from
sdmx manually as it is not in the json dissemination.
