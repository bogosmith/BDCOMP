# Submission template for BDCOMP.
# The first line should contain the email address associated with the participating team. This should not change during the competition. 
# Even if the actual email that is used for submission has to change this field should still contain the email address used for the first submission.
# The next line should contain the label Round X where X is the submission round.
# The next line should be empty.
#
# For each track the submission should contain a line starting with TrackX where X is the track number followed by the short description of the track in brackets as shown below:
# Track1(Unemployment level)
# Track2(HICP - All items)
# Track3(HICP - All items excluding energy)
# Track4(Tourism – number of nights spent at tourist accommodation establishments)
# Track5(Tourism – number of nights spent at hotels and similar accommodation)
# Track6(Volume of retail trade)
# Track7(Volume of retail trade excluding automotive fuel)
# Different tracks should be separated by an empty line.
#
# For each area (country or EU/EZ aggregate) within a track approaches should be separated by one empty line.
# For each approach the following components are allowed raw, sd and sa where
# raw is a mandatory component with the raw estimate, 
# sd is an optional component with the standard deviation of the raw estimate,
# sa is an optional component with the adjusted estimate. The adjustments are outlined in the call. Not applicable for tracks 4 and 5.
# Standard deviation and adjusted estimates will be used for the supplementary evaluation measures.
# The format for each approach is as follows:
#
# ApproachX: raw:n sd:n sa:n
#
# where each n is either an integer or a decimal with one digit after the separator which is a dot '.' .
#
# For tracks 2,3,6 and 7 the forecast should be a number with precision of one digit after the floating point.
# For tracks 1,4 and 5 the forecast should be an integer representing the number forecast it is not required that that integer be a multiple of 1000.
#
# Approaches are outlined in a separate document accompanying the first submission and have to be consistent between submissions for evaluation purposes.
# Final submissions are expected to contain a detailed outline of each approach.
#
# Lines starting with the sign '#' will be ignored.
#
# This format is chosen as a way to accommodate both automated and human processing. 
# Failure to adhere to the format may make the submission impossible to evaluate despite the best effort of the evaluating team.
